# Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire analysis

[nf-core/airrflow](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/4.2.0/):

> nf-core/airrflow is a bioinformatics best-practice pipeline to analyze B-cell or T-cell repertoire sequencing data. It makes use of the Immcantation toolset. The input data can be targeted amplicon bulk sequencing data of the V, D, J and C regions of the B/T-cell receptor with multiplex PCR or 5â€™ RACE protocol, single-cell VDJ sequencing using the 10xGenomics libraries, or assembled reads (bulk or single-cell).
>
> nf-core/airrflow allows the end-to-end processing of BCR and TCR bulk and single cell targeted sequencing data. Several protocols are supported, please see the usage documentation for more details on the supported protocols. The pipeline has been certified as AIRR compliant by the AIRR community, which means that it is compatible with downstream analysis tools also supporting this format.
